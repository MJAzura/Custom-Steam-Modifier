cSteam Modifier is a tool used for changing the sounds of Steam.
Currently, you can:
- Change Sounds
- Generate Batch Script for Task Scheduler
- Create a task for Task Scheduler

So, what does this application really do?
It's simple, it changes your Steam notification sound to your custom .wav!
 
There are two ways of using this app.
 
#Method 1 
Generate a Batch script within the app, save it and add it to the task scheduler, if you tick the "Show Guide" box, a browser will open with a .gif, explaining how to set up automatic execution after logon.
*USING THIS METHOD WILL REQUIRE STEAM TO PATCH THE CUSTOM SOUNDS ON EVERY STARTUP, IF YOU'VE SET UP EVERYTHING LIKE THE APPLICATION SUGGESTS YOU WILL HAVE NO PROBLEMS USINGS THIS TOOL IN THE FUTURE!*
 
#Method 2 
Add -noverifyfiles to your Steam.exe shortcut, this way you won't have the custom sounds if you start your Steam with system log on, you will instead have to run Steam from a shortcut the whole time for it to work.
*USING THIS METHOD IS EASIER BUT YOU HAVE TO RUN STEAM FROM SHORTCUT EVERY TIME IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK, IF YOUR STEAM STARTS UP WITH YOUR SYSTEM YOU'D HAVE TO DISABLE STEAM ON STARTUP AND LAUNCH IT FROM THE SHORTCUT!*
